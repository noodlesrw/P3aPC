  --target1-abs               Interpret R_ARM_TARGET1 as R_ARM_ABS32
  --target2=<type>            Specify definition of R_ARM_TARGET2
  --fix-v4bx                  Rewrite BX rn as MOV pc, rn for ARMv4
  --fix-v4bx-interworking     Rewrite BX rn branch to ARMv4 interworking veneer
  --use-blx                   Enable use of BLX instructions
  --vfp11-denorm-fix          Specify how to fix VFP11 denorm erratum
  --no-enum-size-warning      Don't warn about objects with incompatible
                                enum sizes
  --no-wchar-size-warning     Don't warn about objects with incompatible                                wchar_t sizes
  --pic-veneer                Always generate PIC interworking veneers
   --stub-group-size=N   Maximum size of a group of input sections that can be
                           handled by one stub section.  A negative value
                           locates all stubs after their branches (with a
                           group size of -N), while a positive value allows
                           two groups of input sections, one before, and one
                           after each stub section.  Values of +/-1 indicate
                           the linker should choose suitable defaults.
  --[no-]fix-cortex-a8        Disable/enable Cortex-A8 Thumb-2 branch erratum fix
  --no-merge-exidx-entries    Disable merging exidx entries
