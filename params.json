{"name":"P3aPC","tagline":"PC emulation for Android using QEMU","body":"Welcome to P3aPC Pages.\r\n\r\nThis personal project is targeted at getting an Android device in a state where I can play my old Tomb Raider PC games.\r\n\r\nThe project has been cooking since 2009 or so.\r\n\r\nThis September 2014 marks an epoch in the progress of the project - I finally got QEMU working with mamaich's SDL code. The issue was as he said in the TCG but I forgot that as I went on a long journey to identify and the fix the problem.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n* 1. Update SDL - 1.2.14 to 1.2.15 - done\r\n* 2. Update QEMU - 0.9.1 to 0.15.1 - done\r\n* 3. 3Dfx card emulation - steal from DOSBox\r\n* 4. CD CUE/BIN emulation - steal from DOSBox\r\n* 5. Squease out as much performance as possible from QEMU 0.15.1\r\n* 6. Enjoy replaying old Tomb Raider games :)\r\n\r\nCredit to mamaich for providing the original files and QEMU on android.\r\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=692682\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
